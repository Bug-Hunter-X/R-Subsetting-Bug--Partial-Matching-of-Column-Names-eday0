# R Subsetting Bug: Partial Matching of Column Names

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors for column selection.  The issue stems from R's partial matching behavior, which can lead to unintended consequences when column names share prefixes.

The `bug.R` file contains the buggy code, showcasing the unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version, illustrating how to avoid this problem using exact matching or other more robust methods.

## Bug Description
When subsetting a data frame in R using a character vector of column names, R will perform partial matching by default. If multiple columns share a prefix with the names specified in the character vector, R will select all of those columns. This behavior can be unexpected and lead to errors in your data analysis.

## Solution
The provided solution utilizes the `match` function or explicit matching (using `%in%` operator). This allows you to explicitly select only the exact columns you require, thus preventing partial matching and resolving the issue.
